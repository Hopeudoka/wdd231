        <h1 id="siteName">Site Name: Naija Wedding Vibes</h1>
        <p>This name was chosen to reflect the vibrant and cultural essence of Nigerian weddings. “Naija” is a widely
            recognized nickname for Nigeria and connects instantly with the target audience. “Wedding Vibes”
            communicates celebration, culture, and community, all of which are central themes in Nigerian weddings.</p>

        <h2>Site Purpose: </h2>
        <p>The site serves as a one-stop resource for Nigerian wedding planning. It will feature inspiration galleries,
            vendor directories (planners, photographers, decorators, traditional attire designers, etc.), budgeting
            tips, cultural customs and traditions, and real wedding stories. It will also include planning tools and
            downloadable checklists for brides and grooms.</p>

        <h2>Scenarios: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What are the key traditions in a Yoruba or Igbo wedding ceremony?</li>
            <li>How can I find a trusted wedding planner or makeup artist near Lagos?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Color Schema: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gold (#FFD700): Used for headings and accents to reflect the richness and elegance often associated with
                Nigerian weddings.</li>
            <li>Emerald Green (#008751): Used for backgrounds and buttons, representing prosperity and commonly seen in
                traditional attire.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Typography: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Playfair Display – Used for headings. This serif font adds an elegant, upscale tone to the site.</li>
            <li>Lato – Used for body text and navigation. It’s clean, modern, and highly readable.</li>
            <li>Great Vibes – used for scripted accents like couple names or quotes to give a romantic, personalized
                feel.</li>
        </ul>
